        <p>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created in late 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. At the time he was working at CERN and had proposed it to CERN as a way for scientists to share files to each other. Tim Berners-Lee and a data system engineer
          named Robert Cailliau, requested funding from CERN, but it was not granted. The first document that included HTML markup was called "HTML Tags" and is available <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">here</a>. The tags
          in HTML Tags are fairly simple compared to the tags available today’s HTML&nbsp;5. There have been many variations of HTML with each one bringing new features and new methods of designing websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first version of HTML was released in 1993. This version of HTML had very basic features. Only having the capability of displaying text and images. The very few tags that it did have were the <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> tag, the
          <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;H2&gt;</code>
          tags, <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code> tags and <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tags. It didn’t have any styling possibilities for changing colours or fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1995, HTML&nbsp;2 was released. This version of HTML was a standardised version of HTML that all future versions of HTML would build upon. It had all the capabilities of the first version but with the addition some new HTML tags. Some of
          the new tags that were introduced were the <code>&lt;HEAD&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;BODY&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;LINK&gt;</code> tag which gave the ability to link to other documents. During this time the W3C
          (World Wide Web Consortium) was formed. This organisation was formed to ensure that a standard was kept among the web browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML&nbsp;3.2 was developed in 1997. As with all versions of HTML there were improvements on various aspects of the language. Support CSS embedded in HTML was added which allowed web developers to have greater freedom when it came to
          styling a website. Some notable HTML tags that were introduced were the <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;STYLE&gt;</code> tags which were reserved for use in the future with
          scripting languages and stylesheets respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1999, HTML&nbsp;4.01 was released. With this update of HTML came the support of external style sheets. This was a very important development in terms of web-design. Instead of having to write CSS in each HTML file you could instead make
          a stylesheet that covered the entire website. Some of the tags that were introduced in 4.01 were the <code>&&lt;BUTTON&gt;</code>, <code>&lt; IFRAME&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;SPAN&gt;</code> tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we come to the latest version of HTML, HTML&nbsp;5. HTML&nbsp;5 was initially released in 2008 but in 2014 there was a major update and a W3C recommendation. With this new iteration came a few changes. All the previous versions of HTML
          used tags in uppercase, but now with HTML&nbsp;5 lowercase for tags can be used. HTML&nbsp;5 added various additional tags such as <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> and quite a few
          others. Since 2014 there have been two new HTML&nbsp;5 versions, HTML&nbsp;5.1 and 5.2.

        <p>Like with HTML, there have been many different iterations of CSS through the past few years. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style a HTML webpage. Starting with CSS1 to CSS3. There are three different CSS standards, from CSS to
          CSS3. Håkon Wium Lie first proposed CSS on the tenth of October, 1994 and the first draft of CSS is still available <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html" target="_blank">here</a>. During this time, he was working at
          CERN with Tim Berners-Lee. Bert Boss joined Håkon in developing CSS. Bert Boss was then creating a customisable browser with style sheets called Argo. Many features from Argo eventually made their way into CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1996, CSS1 became an official W3C recommendation. This version of CSS had the ability to change the typeface, the colour of text, backgrounds, and other elements such as the spacing between the words and letters, how text, images and
          tables are aligned and introduced the ability to change the borders, margins and positioning of elements as well as many other capabilities.
        </p>x
        <p>
          CSS2 was developed as a W3C recommendation in May of 1998. This version of CSS featured new capabilities such as absolute, fixed, relative positioning and also the z-index. It also allowed media types and different font options such as
          shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took a considerable amount of time for CSS2.1 to be published as a W3C after going to and from working draft status to candidate recommendation status. CSS2.1 fixed errors that were present in CSS2 and also removed some redundant
          features. CSS2.1 was finally published as a W3C recommendation on the 7th of June 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
          For CSS3 the W3C introduced modules, stating that it was just an awful lot simpler to update individual parts of CSS rather than to add many updates into one single specification. There are now many modules in the CSS specification:
          css3-backround, css3-color, css-fonts-3 and css3-box, among others.
