        <p>
          HTML which stands for Hypertext markup language was created in late 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. At the time he was working at CERN and had proposed it to CERN as a way for scientists to share files to each other. Tim Berners Lee and a data
          system engineer named Robert Cailliau requested for funding from CERN, but CERN did not take it on. The first document that included HTML markup was called "HTML Tags" and is available <a
            href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">here</a>. The tags that are mentioned in this document are fairly simple
          compared
          to the tags that are available today in HTML 5. There have been many variations of HTML. With each one bringing new features and new methods of designing websites. The first version of HTML was used from 1989 to 1995.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first version of HTML was released in 1993. This version of HTML had very basic features. Only having the capability of displaying text and images. The very fee tags that it did have were the <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> tag, the <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;H2&gt;</code>
          tags, <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code> tags and <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tags. It didn’t have any styling possibilities for changing colours or fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1995, HTML 2 was born. This version of HTML was a standardized version of HTML that all future versions of HTML would be built upon. This version of HTML had all the capabilities of the first version but also includes some new HTML tags.
          Some of the new tags that were introduced were the <code>&lt;HEAD&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;BODY&gt;</code> tags, the <code>&lt;LINK&gt;</code> tag, which gave the ability to link to other documents, and it also added the
          <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;</code> tag. During this time the W3C was formed.
          This organisation was formed to ensure that a standard was kept among the web browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML 3.2 was developed in 1997. As with all versions of HTML there were improvements on various aspects of the language. Support CSS embedded in HTML was added which allowed web developers to have greater freedom when it came to styling the
          website. Some notable HTML tags that were introduced was the <code>&lt;DIV&gt</code> tag, the <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code> tag, the <code>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;STYLE&gt;</code> tags which were reserved for use in the future for
          use with scripting languages and stylesheets
          respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1999, HTML 4.01 was released. With this update of HTML came the support of external style sheets. This was a very important development in terms of web-design. Instead of having to write CSS in each HTML file you could just instead make
          a stylesheet that covered the entire website. Some of the tags that were introduced in 4.01 were the <code>&lt;BUTTON&gt;</code> tag, <code>&lt;IFRAME&gt;</code> tag, and the <code>&lt;SPAN&gt;</code> tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we come to the latest version of HTML, HTML 5. HTML 5 was initially released in 2008 but in 2014 there was a major update and a W3C recommendation. With this new iteration came a few changes. All the previous versions of HTML used tags
          in uppercase, but now with HTML 5 you can use lowercase for tags. HTML 5 added various new tags like the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag, the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag, the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag and quite a few others.
          Since 2014 there
          have been two new HTML 5
          versions, HTML5.1, and 5.2.

        <p>Like with HTML there have been many different iterations of CSS through the past few years. CSS stands for Cascading style sheets, and it is used to style a HTML webpage. Starting with CSS 1 to CSS 3. Håkon Wium Lie first proposed CSS on
          the tenth of October, 1994 and the first draft of CSS is still available <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html" target="_blank">here</a>. During this time, he was working at CERN with Tim Berners Lee. Another person by
          the name of Bert Boss joined Håkon in developing CSS. Bert Boss at that time was creating a customizable browser with style sheets called Argo. Many features from Argo eventually made their way into CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1996, CSS 1 became an official W3C recommendation. This version of CSS had the ability to change: The font typeface, the colour of text, backgrounds, and other elements. The spacing between the words and letters. How the text, images and
          tables are aligned. The ability to change the borders, margins and positioning of elements as well as many other capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS 2 was developed as a W3C recommendation in May of 1998. This version of CSS featured new capabilities such as absolute, fixed, relative positioning and also the z-index. It also allowed media types and different font options like
          shadows
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS 2.1 took a long time to finally be published as a W3C after going to and from working draft status to candidate recommendation status. CSS 2.1 fixed errors that were present in CSS 2 and also removed some features that were not needed.
          CSS 2.1 was finally published as a W3C recommendation on the 7th of June 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
          For CSS 3 the W3C implemented modules. The reason they gave for this was that it was just an awful lot simpler to update individual parts of CSS rather than to add loads of updates into one single specification. There quite a few main
          module specifications: css3-backround, css3-color, css-fonts-3 and css3-box among many others.
